# Flex-Grid
Flexbox based grid system for responsive design.

Flex-Grid is an SCSS framework with the purpose of simplifying responsive design. Using BEM naming conventions, classes are written alongside HTML in order to ensure that CSS is not overly-dependent on markup. Different designs are possible at each breakpoint through a mobile-first design strategy.

## Usage


There are currently two ways to support Flex-Grid in your projects:
* Clone the repository
* Download the node module

### Clone the repository


````
git clone https://github.com/NoahT/Flex-Grid.git
cd Flex-Grid
````

### Download the [node module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scss-flexbox-grid)


Before installing as a node module, make sure that [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) is already installed.

````
npm init
npm i --save scss-flexbox-grid
````

After installing, link the compiled CSS file (from the root directory) `./css/bem-grid-system.css` to any HTML files in order to use it.
